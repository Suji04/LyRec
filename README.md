# LyRec: An LLM-powered Song Recommendation System

Do you remember the last time you found yourself obsessing over a song? Maybe it was the raw emotion that resonated with you, or perhaps it was the lyrics that kept you hooked. Or maybe you loved the story it tells. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a way to find songs that express a similar emotion, share similar lyrical elements, or paint similar imagery?

I built ***LyRec*** (see what I did there? ðŸ˜‰), a recommendation system for songs, that lets you do this!
